# Category Management Admin Interface

## Overview
The Category Management Admin Interface provides a comprehensive system for managing product categories and subcategories. This interface allows administrators to create, edit, delete, and organize categories in a hierarchical structure.

## Features

### 1. **Add New Categories**
- Create main categories (no parent)
- Create subcategories (with parent selection)
- Set category type (Food/Clothes)
- Add descriptions and sort order
- Dynamic parent category dropdown based on type

### 2. **Edit Categories**
- Modify category names, types, and descriptions
- Change parent categories (with circular reference prevention)
- Update sort order and active status
- Maintain data integrity during updates

### 3. **Delete Categories**
- Safe deletion with validation checks
- Prevents deletion of categories with subcategories
- Prevents deletion of categories with associated products
- Confirmation dialogs for safety

### 4. **Visual Organization**
- Separate sections for Food and Clothes categories
- Hierarchical display showing main categories and their subcategories
- Color-coded badges for easy identification
- Status indicators (Active/Inactive)

## Interface Layout

### Main Categories Section
- **Food Categories**: Displayed with yellow/warning color scheme
- **Clothes Categories**: Displayed with blue/info color scheme
- Each category shows:
  - Category name and description
  - Type badge
  - List of subcategories (if any)
  - Edit and Delete buttons

### Subcategories Table
- Comprehensive table view of all subcategories
- Shows parent category relationships
- Type and status indicators
- Full CRUD operations

## Database Operations

### Add Category
```sql
INSERT INTO categories (name, type, parent_id, description, sort_order) 
VALUES (?, ?, ?, ?, ?)
```

### Update Category
```sql
UPDATE categories 
SET name = ?, type = ?, parent_id = ?, description = ?, sort_order = ?, is_active = ? 
WHERE id = ?
```

### Delete Category (with validation)
```sql
-- Check for subcategories
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM categories WHERE parent_id = ?

-- Check for products
SELECT COUNT(*) FROM products WHERE category_id = ?

-- Delete if safe
DELETE FROM categories WHERE id = ?
```

## Safety Features

### 1. **Circular Reference Prevention**
- Categories cannot be set as their own parent
- JavaScript validation prevents invalid parent selections

### 2. **Deletion Protection**
- Categories with subcategories cannot be deleted
- Categories with associated products cannot be deleted
- Clear error messages explain why deletion is blocked

### 3. **Data Integrity**
- Foreign key relationships are maintained
- Cascading updates are handled properly
- Validation prevents orphaned records

    // Loads parent categories based on type
    // Excludes current category when editing
}
```

### Form Validation

- Dynamic content updates

## Integration with Products

### Product Form Integration
- Categories are automatically loaded in product forms
- Dynamic filtering based on product type

### API Integration
- `admin/api/get_categories.php` provides category data
- Used by product forms for dynamic loading
- Supports filtering by type and parent
